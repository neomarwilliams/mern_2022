javascript library to build user interfaces

open-source project maintained by Facebook
one of the most popular front end frameworks (along with Angular and Vue)

Why should we learn react
    single page application
        makes our page feel more responsive by eliminating page loads

    we can choose the technologies to use (React is not picky)

    react does not prevent us from using DOM manipulation already built into javascript

    react is popular
        second only to jQuery in usage
        react is the most loved web frameworks

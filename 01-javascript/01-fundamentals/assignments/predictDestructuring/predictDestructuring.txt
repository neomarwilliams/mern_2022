Problem 3
    Prediction:
        console.log(password) will log 12345
        console.log(hashedPassword) will throw an error because the key password does not exist within the object person
    Actual Results:
        first prediction correct
        second prediction logged undefined. Why did it log undefined instead of throwing an error?

        the first prediction logs false becasue second ==5 while first ==2
        the second prediction logs true becase both first and third ==2

1. react works by using objects--called components
2. break down the DOM into a variety of components that have specific behaviors
3. ex. of things-- if you have a form, make a component for the form. if you have a nav bar, make a component for the navbar

4. to use react within HTML include react scripts in the html

<script crossorigin="" src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin="" src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> 

Making a basic component with React--
    React.createElement
        //three main parameters
        1. tell React type of element |  <h1>
        2. pass in props |  {}
        3. include children |  ex. "string within the <h1>" OR nested elements
                ** can also nest another React component

        example:
        const myReactComponent = React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am creating my first React component")

        nested react component
        const myNestedReactComponent = React.createElement("div", {}, React.createElement("p", {}, "This element is nested"))
